## TROUBLESHOOTING

### "I'm Overwhelmed"
**Solution:** Focus on Quick Wins list above. Don't try to do everything at once. One lesson per week is fine.

### "I Don't Have Equipment"
**Solution:** Start with your smartphone. Audio quality matters more than video. Buy a $30 lavalier mic.

### "I'm Not Tech-Savvy"
**Solution:** Most platforms have great tutorials. YouTube is your friend. Or hire a VA for $10-20/hour.

### "What if No One Buys?"
**Solution:** Start with personal outreach. Your first 10 students should be people you know or people in your network.

### "I Don't Have an Audience"
**Solution:** Build as you go. Start creating content NOW. 3 months of consistent posting = 500-1000 engaged followers.

### "What if I'm Not Perfect?"
**Solution:** Done is better than perfect. You can always update the course. Version 1.0 is enough to start.
