- Achiever obsesses over "how"
  - Detailed plans
  - Rigid control
  - Security in plan

- Creator understands:
  - "How" is not his job
  - It's the job of infinite intelligence

- Confirming you're on right path

- Attempting to control life = losing all control
- Forcing outcomes
- Resisting rhythm tides
- Fighting circumstances
- Creates immense friction
- Get exhausted, stressed, reactive
- Fall out of boat, carried away

**True Sovereignty:**
- Born from surrender
