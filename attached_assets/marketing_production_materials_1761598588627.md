### The Problem Section

**Headline:** Are You Stuck in These Patterns?

✓ Feeling like life is happening TO you, not FOR you  
✓ Constantly struggling and exhausted from pushing so hard  
✓ Achieving goals but still feeling empty inside  
✓ Knowing there's "more" but not knowing how to access it  
✓ Repeating the same patterns despite trying to change  
✓ Feeling disconnected from your true self and purpose  

**If you answered yes to any of these, you're living from a lower level of consciousness - and it's not your fault.**

Most people never learn that consciousness has levels. They spend their entire lives viewing reality from the basement, never knowing that higher floors exist.

But here's the truth that will change everything:

**Your circumstances don't determine your experience. Your level of consciousness does.**

The same situation can be experienced as suffering or as opportunity, depending entirely on which floor you're viewing it from.

### Short-Form Video Scripts

**Video 1: "The Building Metaphor" (60 seconds)**
```
Hook: "Imagine consciousness as a 7-storey building."

Most people are born in the basement. They spend their entire lives there, believing that's all there is.

From the basement, life looks dark. Limited. Scary.

But here's the thing - the stairs were always there.

[Show visual of building with levels]

Level 1: Victim - "Life happens to me"
Level 2: Warrior - "Life is a battle"
Level 3: Achiever - "Life is a game to win"
Level 4: Intention - "Life reflects my inner state"
Level 5: Flow - "Life is a dance"
Level 6: Unity - "Life is One"
Level 7: Being - "I AM life"

Same building. Seven completely different views.

Your circumstances haven't changed.
Your floor has.

Want to know which floor you're on and how to move up?

Link in bio.
```

**Video 2: "The Responsibility Shift" (60 seconds)**
```
Hook: "The moment everything changed for me."

I used to blame everyone.

The economy. My boss. My parents. My ex.

Someone else was always responsible for why my life wasn't working.

And you know what? That belief made me powerless.

Because if they had the power, I didn't.

Then I learned this: Radical responsibility.

It's not about blame. It's about reclaiming your power.

It's asking: "How did I contribute to this? What can I control? What's my response?"

The moment I stopped blaming others, everything shifted.

Not because my circumstances changed.

Because my consciousness changed.

And when your consciousness changes, your reality has no choice but to follow.

Ready to make that shift?

Course in bio.
```
